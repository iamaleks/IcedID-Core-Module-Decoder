# IcedID Core Module Decoder and Reconstructor

This program will parse the payload IcedID stores on disk, commonly named licence.dat, and will convert this into a PE file that can be analyzed using static methods.

The following sample was used during the development of this reconstructor:
- IcedID Sample from [Malware Traffic](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2022/09/23/index.html)
- licence.dat Sample [55be890947d021fcc8c29af3c7aaf70d8132f222e944719c43a6e819e84a8f8b](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/55be890947d021fcc8c29af3c7aaf70d8132f222e944719c43a6e819e84a8f8b)
